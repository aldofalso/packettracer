# packettracer

Forked from tjota and modified to work on most (?) recent Fedora releases. Tested on Fedora Workstation 33 beta.

1. Clone the repo and place PacketTracer_731_amd64.deb (downloaded from Cisco Netacad) in the same directory. 
2. chmod +x pt731_fedora_install.sh
3. ./pt731_fedora_install.sh
4. Log out and back in, or reboot your system to ensure all paths are updated correctly.
5. Run PacketTracer7 from the applications menu
